Implementations based on WebRTC and WebSocket to be done. RemarkWhen using API, it may not work from the first attempt. This is because WebRTC uses ws://sigver-coastteam.rhcloud.com:8000 signaling server by default. Due to the rhcloud application hosting specification, following a period of inactivity, the server will be available after a while. Try it again a few seconds later. API specification (warning: alpha state)RemarksPerhaps WebChannel.openForJoining and WebChannel.closeForJoining could be used in case of WebRTC and WebSocket. Maybe leave the possibility to the API user to decide either is an invite-only WebChannel or not. Lets implement and see. WebChannelMethods onJoining: function (peerId: string) When new peer has joined the WebChannel. onLeaving: function (peerId: string) When the peerId peer has disconnected from the WebChannel. onMessage: function (peerId: string, msg: string) When a broadcast message has arrived from the peerId peer. Attributes leave () Disconnect from this WebChannel. send (data: string): Promise Send broadcast message to this WebChannel. openForJoining (options: Object): string Enable other peers to join this WebChannel with your help as an intermediary peer. Returns key. closeForJoining () Prevent other peers to join this WebChannel even if they have a key. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.0 on 2016-03-07T17:11:46+01:00 using the DocStrap template.

This function is used to add a new peer to the webChannel. For exemple: A, B, C constitute the webChannel. N1 and N2 are not the webChannel members and they are about to join it. N1 is connected to A. Thus A is the intermediary peer for communicate with N1. N2 is connected to C thereby C is the intermediary peer for N2.

Returns: Once peerExecutor established all required connections, the promise is resolved, otherwise it is rejected. Type Promise &lt;abstract&gt; join(key, options) Connects you with the peer who provided the key. Parameters: Name Type Description key type A key obtained from a peer. options type = {} Any other options which depend on the implementation.

Parameters: Name Type Description key string The key provided by a WebChannel member. options type = {} Any available connection service options. Returns: Is resolve once you became a WebChannel member. Type Promise leave() Leave WebChannel. No longer can receive and send messages to the group. onJoining(id) This event handler is called when a new member has joined the WebChannel. Parameters: Name Type Description id string Peer id. onLeaving(id) This event handler is called when a WebChannel member has left.
